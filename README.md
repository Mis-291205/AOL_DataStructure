# AOL_DataStructure

A C program that implements a slang dictionary called “Boogle” using a Trie (prefix tree) data structure, where users can release (add) new slang words with descriptions, search for specific slang words, view slang words that begin with a certain prefix, and display all slang words stored. It ensures slang words contain no spaces and descriptions have at least two words, while providing a menu-driven interface that repeatedly prompts the user until they choose to exit.
